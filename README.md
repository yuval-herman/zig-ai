This is a short and simple experiment I made to better understand how AI works under the hood.
You can use it as a reference if you like however it is not very well made or documented.

In order to best understand the inner working of AI I choose not to use any library outside the standard library and even implemented the math operations behind the Backpropagation algorithm myself.

I used mostly [Michael Nielsen's](https://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) as a reference and learning guide.
I also gained a much better understanding from the awesome Sebastian Lague in his video [How to Create a Neural Network (and Train it to Identify Doodles)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfMk-kjRv4c). Lastly, I tried to use
